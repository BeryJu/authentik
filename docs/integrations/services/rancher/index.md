# Rancher Integration

## What is Rancher

From https://rancher.com/products/rancher

!!! note ""
    An Enterprise Platform for Managing Kubernetes Everywhere
    Rancher is a platform built to address the needs of the DevOps teams deploying applications with Kubernetes, and the IT staff responsible for delivering an enterprise-critical service.

## Preparation

The following placeholders will be used:

-   `rancher.company` is the FQDN of the Rancher Install
-   `passbook.company` is the FQDN of the passbook Install

Create an application in passbook and note the slug, as this will be used later. Create a SAML Provider with the following Parameters:

-   ACS URL: `https://rancher.company/v1-saml/adfs/saml/acs`
-   Audience: `https://rancher.company/v1-saml/adfs/saml/metadata`
-   Issuer: `passbook`

You can of course use a custom Signing Certificate, and adjust durations.
