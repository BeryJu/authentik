title: SAML Provider
---

This provider allows you to integrate enterprise software using the SAML2 Protocol. It supports signed requests and uses [Property Mappings](../property-mappings/index.md#saml-property-mapping) to determine which fields are exposed and what values they return. This makes it possible to expose vendor-specific fields.
Default fields are exposed through auto-generated Property Mappings, which are prefixed with "Autogenerated".
