title: Property Mappings
---

Property Mappings allow you to pass information to external applications. For example, pass the current user's groups as a SAML parameter. Property Mappings are also used to map Source fields to passbook fields, for example when using LDAP.

## SAML Property Mapping

SAML Property Mappings allow you embed information into the SAML AuthN request. This information can then be used by the application to, for example, assign permissions to the object.

You can find examples [here](integrations/).

## LDAP Property Mapping

LDAP Property Mappings are used when you define a LDAP Source. These mappings define which LDAP property maps to which passbook property. By default, the following mappings are created:

- Autogenerated LDAP Mapping: givenName -> first_name
- Autogenerated LDAP Mapping: mail -> email
- Autogenerated LDAP Mapping: name -> name
- Autogenerated LDAP Mapping: sAMAccountName -> username
- Autogenerated LDAP Mapping: sn -> last_name

These are configured with most common LDAP setups.

## Scope Mapping

Scope Mappings are used by the OAuth2 Provider to map information from passbook to OAuth2/OpenID Claims.
