title: Invitation stage
---

This stage can be used to invite users. You can use this to enroll users with preset values.

If the option `Continue Flow without Invitation` is enabled, this stage will continue even when no invitation token is present.

To check if a user has used an invitation within a policy, you can check `request.context.invitation_in_effect`.
